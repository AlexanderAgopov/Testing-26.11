			width="96px" height="108" align="left">XML stands for
		Extensible Markup Language. It is a text-based markup language derived
		from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). XML tags identify
		the data and are used to store and organize the data, rather than
		specifying how to display it like HTML tags, which are used to display
		the data. XML is not going to replace HTML in the near future, but it
		introduces new possibilities by adopting many successful features of
		HTML. There are three important characteristics of XML that make it
		useful in a variety of systems and solutions − XML is extensible − XML
		allows you to create your own self-descriptive tags, or language, that
		suits your application. XML carries the data, does not present it −
		XML allows you to store the data irrespective of how it will be
		presented. XML is a public standard − XML was developed by an
		organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is
		available as an open standard. A short list of XML usage says it all −
		XML can work behind the scene to simplify the creation of HTML
		documents for large web sites. XML can be used to exchange the
		information between organizations and systems. XML can be used for
		offloading and reloading of databases. XML can be used to store and
		arrange the data, which can customize your data handling needs. XML
		can easily be merged with style sheets to create almost any desired
		output. Virtually, any type of data can be expressed as an XML
		document.What is Markup? XML is a markup language that defines set of
		rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable
		and machine-readable. So what exactly is a markup language? Markup is
		information added to a document that enhances its meaning in certain
		ways, in that it identifies the parts and how they relate to each
		other. More specifically, a markup language is a set of symbols that
		can be placed in the text of a document to demarcate and label the
		parts of that document.
